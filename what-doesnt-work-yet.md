# What Doesn't Work Yet

> **üí° Motivation:** Set realistic expectations and identify areas that might improve with future developments.
> 
> **üìù Content:** Limitations that are technology-related but potentially solvable. Distinguish between "not yet" and "fundamentally not possible."

## Complex Multi-Step Reasoning
**Context:** Planning complex projects or architectures

**Experience:** Struggles with:
- Long-term project planning with multiple dependencies
- Complex business logic that requires deep domain understanding
- Multi-step mathematical proofs or complex calculations
- Strategic decision-making requiring extensive context

**Learnings:** Break complex problems into smaller, manageable chunks with clear intermediate steps.

## Real-Time Data Integration
**Context:** Working with live, changing data

**Experience:** Limited by:
- No access to real-time APIs or databases
- Cannot verify current information accuracy
- Struggles with time-sensitive decision making
- Cannot maintain state between conversations

**Learnings:** Combine LLM capabilities with real-time data tools and APIs.

## Deep Business Context Understanding
**Context:** Enterprise-specific solutions

**Experience:** Challenges include:
- Understanding complex organizational structures
- Navigating company-specific processes and constraints
- Interpreting business requirements without extensive context
- Making decisions that require insider knowledge

**Learnings:** Provide extensive context documentation and use iterative refinement.

## File System & Environment Interaction
**Context:** Direct system administration and file manipulation

**Experience:** Cannot reliably:
- Perform complex file operations across directories
- Understand system state and environment variables
- Execute long-running scripts or processes
- Manage dependencies and environment setup

**Learnings:** Use LLMs for planning and code generation, then execute manually or through proper tooling.
