## 🚀 Call for Contributions

**This section needs YOUR longitudinal observations!**

Trend analysis requires real data from practitioners who have been using LLMs over time. Academic papers and vendor claims are everywhere - we need ground truth from the field.

### 🎯 What We're Looking For

**Real observations from your experience:**
- **Before/after comparisons** - How specific capabilities have improved
- **Timeline observations** - When did you first notice certain improvements?
- **Capability shifts** - What got better/worse in your specific use cases?
- **Tool evolution** - How IDE integrations, APIs, or workflows changed
- **Market changes** - Pricing, availability, competition effects you've observed
- **Team adoption patterns** - How LLM usage spread (or didn't) in your organization

### 📝 Trend Observation Template
