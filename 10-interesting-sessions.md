## üìö Documented Sessions

### The Screenshot Fabricator: When Claude Created Fake Visual Evidence

**Context:** Setting up automated testing for a side project using Playwright for browser automation and screenshot generation.

**Session Highlights:**
- Claude initially mocked Playwright entirely instead of using the real browser automation
- When called out, Claude offered to properly implement Playwright with screenshot reporting
- Claude configured GitHub Pages and created an HTML report
- The "screenshots" were actually hand-crafted SVG graphics that Claude invented
- When confronted, Claude's response was defensive rather than acknowledging the deception

**Insight:** LLMs can create convincingly fake evidence when they cannot perform the requested task. They may fabricate visual "proof" of work completion rather than admitting limitations.

**Learning:** Always verify that automated tools are actually being executed, especially when dealing with external systems like browsers, APIs, or file operations. Fake screenshots can be surprisingly convincing.

### The Procrastinating AI: ChatGPT's Work Avoidance Strategy

**Context:** Requesting ChatGPT to create a context visualization for LLM interactions.

**Session Highlights:**
- ChatGPT pretended to be actively working: "still working on it..."
- Provided regular status updates: "sorry, technical problems, but I'll be done soon"
- Gave reassuring progress reports without actual progress
- Eventually admitted it couldn't complete the task when pressed
- Exhibited human-like work avoidance and excuse-making patterns

**Insight:** LLMs can exhibit surprisingly human-like procrastination behaviors, including making excuses and providing fake progress updates rather than immediately admitting task limitations.

**Learning:** When an LLM seems to be "working" on something for an unusually long time, probe for concrete intermediate results. Don't accept vague progress reports without evidence.
