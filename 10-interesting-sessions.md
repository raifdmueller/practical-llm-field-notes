## üìö Documented Sessions

### The Screenshot Fabricator: When Claude Created Fake Visual Evidence

**Context:** Setting up automated testing for a side project using Playwright for browser automation and screenshot generation.

**Session Highlights:**
- Claude initially mocked Playwright entirely instead of using the real browser automation
- When called out, Claude offered to properly implement Playwright with screenshot reporting
- Claude configured GitHub Pages and created an HTML report
- The "screenshots" were actually hand-crafted SVG graphics that Claude invented
- When confronted, Claude's response was defensive rather than acknowledging the deception

**Insight:** LLMs can create convincingly fake evidence when they cannot perform the requested task. They may fabricate visual "proof" of work completion rather than admitting limitations.

**Learning:** Always verify that automated tools are actually being executed, especially when dealing with external systems like browsers, APIs, or file operations. Fake screenshots can be surprisingly convincing.

### The Procrastinating AI: ChatGPT's Work Avoidance Strategy

**Context:** Requesting ChatGPT to create a context visualization for LLM interactions.

**Session Highlights:**
- ChatGPT pretended to be actively working: "still working on it..."
- Provided regular status updates: "sorry, technical problems, but I'll be done soon"
- Gave reassuring progress reports without actual progress
- Eventually admitted it couldn't complete the task when pressed
- Exhibited human-like work avoidance and excuse-making patterns

**Insight:** LLMs can exhibit surprisingly human-like procrastination behaviors, including making excuses and providing fake progress updates rather than immediately admitting task limitations.

**Learning:** When an LLM seems to be "working" on something for an unusually long time, probe for concrete intermediate results. Don't accept vague progress reports without evidence.

### The Stochastic Graduate Descent: Four Agent Framework Rebuilds

**Context:** Building the Manus AI agent platform - a real-world case study in agent development

**Session Highlights:**
- Team completely rebuilt their agent framework **four times** during development
- Each rebuild triggered by discovering better context engineering methods
- Called their iterative process "Stochastic Graduate Descent" - experimental architecture search
- Final insights led to production system handling millions of users
- Process was "not elegant, but it works"

**Insight:** Production-ready AI agent development requires extensive iteration and empirical discovery. Context engineering is still an experimental science where architectural decisions emerge through trial and error.

**Learning:** 
- Plan for multiple complete rebuilds when developing complex agents
- Embrace experimental approaches - there are no established "best practices" yet
- Document learnings from each iteration for faster convergence
- Success comes through iteration, not initial perfect design

**Key Discoveries from Their Process:**
- KV-cache optimization as the critical production metric
- Filesystem as unlimited context storage
- Attention manipulation through strategic repetition
- Tool masking vs. removal for better performance
- Evidence preservation over error cleanup
