## Code Analysis & Review
**Context:** Daily development workflows

**Experience:** LLMs excel at:
- Spotting potential bugs and edge cases
- Suggesting code improvements and refactoring opportunities
- Explaining complex code logic
- Identifying security vulnerabilities in code snippets

**Learnings:** Works best with well-structured code and clear context about the intended functionality.

## Documentation Generation
**Context:** Technical documentation creation

**Experience:** Highly effective for:
- Converting code comments into structured documentation
- Creating API documentation from code signatures
- Generating user guides from technical specifications
- Writing README files and setup instructions

**Learnings:** Provide clear templates and examples for consistent output quality.

## Learning & Explanation
**Context:** Understanding new technologies or concepts

**Experience:** Excellent at:
- Breaking down complex technical concepts
- Providing step-by-step tutorials
- Explaining error messages and debugging steps
- Creating analogies and examples for difficult topics

**Learnings:** Best when you can iteratively refine the explanation depth and style.

## Template & Boilerplate Creation
**Context:** Starting new projects or standardizing approaches

**Experience:** Very reliable for:
- Creating project scaffolding and directory structures
- Generating configuration files (Docker, CI/CD, etc.)
- Building form templates and UI components
- Creating test frameworks and example data

**Learnings:** Specify your tech stack and constraints clearly for better results.
