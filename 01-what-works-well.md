## Code Analysis & Review (Simple Cases)
**Context:** Daily development workflows for straightforward issues

**Experience:** LLMs work well for:
- Spotting obvious bugs and simple edge cases
- Basic code improvements and style suggestions
- Explaining what code does (ad-hoc explanations)
- Identifying common security patterns (SQL injection, XSS basics)

**Learnings:** Works best with simple, isolated code snippets. Complex architectural issues, subtle race conditions, or business-logic problems often require human expertise.

## Translation & Localization
**Context:** Converting content between languages

**Experience:** Highly effective for:
- Technical documentation translation
- User interface text and error messages
- Code comments and README files
- API documentation in multiple languages
- Marketing copy and user-facing content

**Learnings:** Provide context about target audience and technical domain. Review for cultural appropriateness and technical accuracy.

## Learning & Explanation
**Context:** Understanding new technologies or concepts

**Experience:** Excellent at:
- Breaking down complex technical concepts
- Providing step-by-step tutorials
- Explaining error messages and debugging steps
- Creating analogies and examples for difficult topics
- Ad-hoc code explanations ("What does this function do?")

**Learnings:** Best when you can iteratively refine the explanation depth and style.

## Template & Boilerplate Creation
**Context:** Starting new projects or standardizing approaches

**Experience:** Very reliable for:
- Creating project scaffolding and directory structures
- Generating configuration files (Docker, CI/CD, etc.)
- Building form templates and UI components
- Creating test frameworks and example data
- Standard document templates (meeting notes, reports)

**Learnings:** Specify your tech stack and constraints clearly for better results.

## Text Processing & Analysis
**Context:** Working with large amounts of text content

**Experience:** Strong capabilities for:
- Summarizing long documents and articles
- Extracting key information from unstructured text
- Converting between formats (Markdown, HTML, plain text)
- Proofreading and grammar checking
- Content classification and tagging

**Learnings:** Works best when you provide clear criteria for what constitutes important information.
