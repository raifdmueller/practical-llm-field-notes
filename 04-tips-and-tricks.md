## Effective Prompting Strategies

### Context-First Approach
```
BAD: "Write a function to sort data"
GOOD: "I'm building a Python web app that processes user uploads. 
Write a function that sorts a list of dictionaries by timestamp, 
handling missing dates gracefully."
```

### Provide Your Context (Not LLM Role)
```
BAD: "Act as a senior software architect and review this code"
GOOD: "I'm a senior software architect working with Java microservices. 
I need help reviewing this code for scalability and maintainability issues."
```

**Why:** Telling the LLM your background gives context about your expertise level. Assigning roles to the LLM can actually limit its solution space in exploratory conversations.

### Let the LLM Lead (Role Reversal)
```
"I have a performance problem with my web application. 
Ask me questions to understand the issue, then suggest solutions."

"I need to design a new feature but I'm not sure about the approach. 
Interview me about the requirements and help me think through the options."
```

**Why:** Leverages the LLM's broad knowledge to explore solution spaces you might not consider.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown
```
Instead of: "Create a complete authentication system"
Try: "Let's build authentication step by step:
1. First, create a user registration form
2. Then we'll add password hashing
3. Finally, implement login sessions"
```

## Context Management

### Structured Request Template
```
**Background:** [Your role/expertise level]
**Context:** [What you're building/working on]
**Goal:** [What you want to achieve]
**Constraints:** [Technical limitations, requirements]
**Format:** [How you want the output structured]
```

**Note:** Templates help you organize thoughts and provide complete context, but they're not magic formulas for better LLM performance.

### Iterative Refinement
- Start with a broad request to explore possibilities
- Ask for specific improvements based on initial output
- Build complexity gradually
- Save working versions before major changes
- Use "What would you change if..." for alternatives

## Technical Considerations

### Specify Your Stack (Mind the Knowledge Cutoff)
```
GOOD: "Using React 18 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite..."
BETTER: "Using React 18 (released March 2022) with TypeScript..."
BEST: "Using React 18 - here's the current API documentation: [paste relevant docs]"
```

**Why:** LLMs have knowledge cutoffs. For newer technologies or versions, provide current documentation or use tools like GitMCP to extend knowledge.

### Request Concrete Examples
```
BAD: "Explain error handling best practices"
GOOD: "Show me 3 specific error handling patterns for REST APIs, 
with code examples for each"
```

### Ask for Alternatives and Trade-offs
```
"Show me 2-3 different approaches to solve this, with pros/cons for each"
"What are the trade-offs between approach A and B for my use case?"
```

## Recovery and Refinement

### When the LLM Doesn't Understand
```
"Let me rephrase that differently..."
"Here's a concrete example of what I mean: [example]"
"What additional information do you need to help me with this?"
```

### Course Correction
```
"That's close, but I need something more focused on [specific aspect]"
"The approach is right, but can you adapt it for [different constraint]?"
```

### Knowledge Gaps
```
"If you're not sure about [specific technology], let me know what 
information would help you give better advice"
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Constraint-Based Prompting
```
"I need a solution that works with these specific constraints:
- Must be under 100 lines of code
- Cannot use external libraries
- Must handle 1000+ concurrent users"
```

### Perspective Switching
```
"Now look at this same problem from a security perspective"
"What would a DevOps engineer be concerned about with this approach?"
```

### Error-First Thinking
```
"What could go wrong with this approach?"
"What edge cases should I be worried about?"
"How would this fail at scale?"
```
