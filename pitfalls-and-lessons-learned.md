## Over-Reliance Pitfalls

### The "Magic Solution" Trap
**Problem:** Expecting LLMs to solve complex problems without human oversight

**Experience:** Led to:
- Accepting plausible but incorrect solutions
- Missing critical edge cases
- Implementing inefficient algorithms
- Security vulnerabilities in generated code

**Learning:** Always review, test, and validate LLM outputs, especially for critical functionality.

### Context Window Limitations
**Problem:** Trying to process too much information at once

**Experience:** Results in:
- Truncated responses
- Loss of important context
- Inconsistent outputs
- Performance degradation

**Learning:** Break large tasks into smaller chunks and maintain context explicitly.

## Quality Control Issues

### Hallucination Recognition
**Problem:** LLMs generating confident but incorrect information

**Common Signs:**
- Outdated API references
- Non-existent libraries or functions
- Incorrect syntax for specific language versions
- Made-up documentation links

**Learning:** Verify all technical details, especially version-specific information.

### Consistency Problems
**Problem:** Different outputs for similar requests

**Experience:**
- Varying code styles within the same project
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- Different approaches to similar problems

**Learning:** Use explicit style guides and examples in prompts.

## Workflow Mistakes

### Prompt Dependency
**Problem:** Creating workflows that only work with specific prompts

**Experience:**
- Difficulty reproducing results
- Team members unable to replicate workflows
- Fragile automation that breaks with minor changes

**Learning:** Document successful prompts and create reusable templates.

### Version Control Neglect
**Problem:** Not tracking LLM-generated content properly

**Experience:**
- Lost track of what was human vs. AI-generated
- Difficulty debugging generated code
- Problems with intellectual property attribution

**Learning:** Clearly mark AI-generated content and maintain proper version control.
