## Deterministic Calculations
**Context:** Precise mathematical operations

**Experience:** Unreliable for:
- Complex arithmetic without calculation tools
- Financial calculations requiring precision
- Statistical analysis of large datasets
- Cryptographic operations

**Learnings:** Always use proper calculation tools for mathematical operations.

## Memory & State Management
**Context:** Long-running processes requiring persistent state

**Experience:** Cannot:
- Remember information between separate conversations
- Maintain context across browser sessions
- Learn from previous interactions
- Build up knowledge over time

**Learnings:** Design workflows that don't depend on persistent memory.

## Real-Time Verification
**Context:** Fact-checking and accuracy validation

**Experience:** Cannot:
- Verify current facts or recent events
- Access live databases or APIs
- Confirm the accuracy of generated information
- Provide real-time updates

**Learnings:** Always verify critical information through authoritative sources.

## Creative Originality at Scale
**Context:** Truly novel creative work

**Experience:** Limited in:
- Creating genuinely new artistic styles
- Developing breakthrough scientific theories
- Producing entirely original business models
- Inventing new programming paradigms

**Learnings:** Use for inspiration and iteration, not for groundbreaking innovation.
