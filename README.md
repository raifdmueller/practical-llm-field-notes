## 📖 Philosophy

This collection is built on the principle that **practical experience beats theoretical knowledge**. Rather than another tutorial or framework comparison, these are real field notes from developers, architects, and teams using LLMs in production environments.

### Our Focus:
- **Practical over theoretical** - Real experiences, not speculation
- **Balanced perspective** - Both capabilities and limitations
- **Community-driven** - Crowdsourced wisdom from practitioners
- **Living document** - Continuously updated as technology evolves
