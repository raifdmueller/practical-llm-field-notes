# What Doesn't Work
> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** Many limitations from 2023-2024 are now solvable with MCP (Model Context Protocol) and tool integration. This section focuses on remaining fundamental constraints.

## Creative Originality at Scale
**Context:** Truly novel creative work

**Experience:** Limited in:
- Creating genuinely new artistic styles or movements
- Developing breakthrough scientific theories
- Producing entirely original business models
- Inventing fundamentally new programming paradigms
- Revolutionary conceptual breakthroughs

**Learnings:** Use for inspiration, iteration, and refinement, not for groundbreaking innovation. LLMs excel at combining existing ideas in new ways.

## Complex Human Judgment & Ethics
**Context:** Decisions requiring nuanced human values

**Experience:** Struggles with:
- Complex ethical dilemmas with cultural context
- Legal decisions requiring interpretation and precedent
- Medical diagnoses requiring human intuition
- Personnel decisions involving emotional intelligence
- Strategic business decisions requiring "gut feeling"

**Learnings:** Use LLMs for information gathering and analysis, but keep human judgment in the loop for value-based decisions.

## Physical World Interaction
**Context:** Tasks requiring physical presence or manipulation

**Experience:** Cannot:
- Physically inspect hardware or installations
- Perform hands-on troubleshooting
- Validate physical measurements or conditions
- Interact with non-networked systems
- Provide in-person services or support

**Learnings:** LLMs can help plan and guide physical tasks, but cannot replace on-site expertise.

## Deep Tacit Knowledge & Experience
**Context:** Skills developed through years of practice

**Experience:** Limited in:
- Recognizing subtle patterns from years of experience
- "Reading between the lines" in complex human situations
- Intuitive problem-solving based on accumulated wisdom
- Understanding unspoken organizational dynamics
- Knowing what questions to ask in unfamiliar domains

**Learnings:** LLMs can supplement experience but cannot replace the insights that come from years of practice in a domain.

## ‚úÖ Now Solvable with MCP/Tools (Moved from "Doesn't Work")

These were fundamental limitations in 2023-2024 but are now addressable:

### **Deterministic Calculations** ‚Üí Use MCP with code interpreters
### **Memory & State Management** ‚Üí Use MCP with file systems or databases  
### **Real-Time Verification** ‚Üí Use MCP with web search and APIs
### **Data Analysis** ‚Üí Use MCP with specialized analysis tools

**Key Insight:** The LLM ecosystem has evolved rapidly. Many "impossible" tasks from 2023 are now routine with proper tool integration.

## üöÄ Report New Fundamental Limitations

**Found something that still doesn't work even with tools?**

We want to know about:
- **Persistent limitations** despite tool access
- **New limitations** discovered with advanced setups
- **Edge cases** where tools don't help
- **Fundamental constraints** that seem unlikely to be solved
