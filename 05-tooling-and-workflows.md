# Tooling & Workflows

> **💡 Motivation:** Document proven tools and workflows that enhance LLM integration into existing processes.
> 
> **📝 Content:** Software, plugins, IDEs, CI/CD integration, automation.

> **⚠️ Initial Content:** These are common tool categories and basic examples to get started.
> 
> **We need YOUR specific workflow experiences and tool combinations that actually work!**

### Terminal Integration
- **GitHub Copilot CLI:** Command suggestions and explanations
- **Shell-GPT:** Direct LLM access from command line
- **AI commit message generators:** For consistent commit formatting

## Documentation Workflows

### Docs-as-Code Integration
- Use LLMs to generate initial arc42 templates

- Create user guides from technical specifications
- Generate changelogs from commit messages

### Quality Assurance
- Review generated content for accuracy
- Use version control for documentation changes
- Implement peer review processes for AI-generated content

## Automation Strategies

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
```yaml
# Example: Automated code review comments
- name: AI Code Review
  run: |
    # Generate review comments for changed files
    # Post findings as PR comments
```

### Content Generation Pipelines
- Automated README updates
- Release note generation
- API documentation updates
- Test case generation

## Data Processing Workflows

### File Analysis Pipeline
1. **Prepare:** Clean and structure input data
2. **Analyze:** Use LLM for pattern recognition and insights
3. **Validate:** Cross-check critical findings
4. **Document:** Generate reports and summaries

## 🚀 Share Your Real Workflows

**What specific tool combinations and workflows actually work for you?**

We especially want:
- **Complete workflow descriptions** - step-by-step processes you actually use
- **Tool integration details** - how you connected different systems
- **Performance metrics** - time savings, quality improvements, adoption rates
- **Failure stories** - what integrations seemed good but didn't work
- **Team adoption strategies** - how you rolled out LLM tools successfully
- **Security and compliance approaches** - how you handled sensitive data

### Example Workflow Template
```markdown
### [Workflow Name]

**Context:** [Team size, technology stack, industry]
**Goal:** [What you were trying to achieve]
**Tools Used:** [Specific tools and versions]

**Process:**
1. [Step by step process]
2. [Include specific commands, configs, or scripts]
3. [Decision points and alternatives]

**Results:**
- [Quantifiable outcomes]
- [What worked well]
- [What didn't work]

**Lessons Learned:** [Key insights for others]
