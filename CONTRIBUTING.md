# Contributing to Practical LLM Field Notes

Thank you for considering contributing to this collection! Your real-world experiences with LLMs help the entire community learn and improve.

## üéØ What We're Looking For

### Great Contributions Include:
- **Specific examples** rather than general observations
- **Context** about the situation and constraints
- **Actual outcomes** - what worked, what didn't, and why
- **Learnings** that others can apply
- **Balanced perspectives** - both successes and limitations

### Examples of Valuable Content:
- A specific prompt that solved a tricky problem
- A workflow that improved your team's productivity
- A failure case that taught you something important
- An unexpected capability you discovered
- A tool combination that works particularly well

## üìù How to Contribute

### 1. Choose the Right Section
Each section has a specific purpose:

- **What Works Well:** Proven successes and reliable use cases
- **What Doesn't Work Yet:** Current limitations that might improve
- **What Doesn't Work:** Fundamental limitations to be aware of
- **Tips & Tricks:** Practical techniques and optimizations
- **Tooling & Workflows:** Integration approaches and tool recommendations
- **Pitfalls & Lessons Learned:** Common mistakes and how to avoid them
- **Use Cases & Domains:** Industry or domain-specific applications
- **Quality Assessment:** Methods for evaluating LLM outputs
- **Development & Trends:** Observations about improvements over time
- **Interesting Sessions:** Particularly noteworthy interactions

### 2. Follow the Format
Each contribution should include:

```markdown
### [Descriptive Title]

**Context:** [Brief description of the situation/domain/goal]

**Experience:** [What happened - the actual experience or observation]

**Learnings:** [Key takeaways that others can apply]
```

### 3. Submission Process
1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Create a branch** for your contribution (`git checkout -b my-contribution`)
3. **Add your content** to the appropriate section in README.md
4. **Commit** with a clear message (`git commit -m "Add experience with X in Y context"`)
5. **Push** your branch (`git push origin my-contribution`)
6. **Create a Pull Request** with a description of what you're adding

## ‚úÖ Quality Guidelines

### Do Include:
- Real experiences from actual use
- Specific tools, versions, or contexts
- Quantifiable results when possible
- Code snippets or examples (anonymized)
- Screenshots or outputs (if helpful)

### Don't Include:
- Theoretical discussions without practical application
- Marketing claims about tools or services
- Sensitive information (API keys, proprietary code, personal data)
- Vague generalizations without specific examples
- Duplicate content already covered

## üîí Privacy and Anonymization

When sharing experiences:
- **Remove sensitive data:** API keys, passwords, company names, personal information
- **Anonymize code:** Replace specific business logic with generic examples
- **Generalize contexts:** "E-commerce platform" instead of "Shopify store for XYZ Company"
- **Focus on the technique:** The approach matters more than the specific details

## üé® Style Guidelines

### Writing Style:
- Use clear, concise language
- Write in second person ("you") when giving advice
- Use present tense for current capabilities
- Use past tense for experiences and outcomes

### Formatting:
- Use proper markdown formatting
- Include code blocks with appropriate language tags
- Use bullet points for lists
- Keep lines under 100 characters when possible

### Code Examples:
```markdown
\```python
# Good: Include language tag and comments
def process_data(data):
    """Process user data with error handling."""
    try:
        return clean_data(data)
    except ValueError as e:
        logger.error(f"Data processing failed: {e}")
        return None
\```
```
