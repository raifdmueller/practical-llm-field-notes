## üöÄ Call for Contributions

**This section needs YOUR software architecture and development experiences!**

We're focusing on the intersection of LLMs with professional software development and architectural work.

### üéØ What We're Looking For

**Real experiences in:**
- **Architecture Design** - System design, technology selection, pattern application
- **Code Development** - Implementation, refactoring, debugging, testing
- **Technical Documentation** - Architecture docs, API documentation, technical specifications
- **Code Review & Quality** - Review processes, quality gates, technical debt management
- **Developer Productivity** - Workflow optimization, automation, tool integration
- **Technical Decision Making** - Technology evaluation, trade-off analysis, ADRs
