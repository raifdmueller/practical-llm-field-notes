## AI Agent Development Pitfalls

*Source: [Context Engineering for AI Agents - Manus](https://manus.im/de/blog/Context-Engineering-for-AI-Agents-Lessons-from-Building-Manus)*

### The Few-Shot Pattern Trap

**Problem:** Agents get stuck in repetitive behavior when context contains similar action-observation patterns

**Context:** Building an agent to process multiple similar tasks (e.g., reviewing 20 resumes, processing documents)

**Experience:** 
- Agent starts performing well on first few items
- Gradually becomes mechanical, following exact same pattern
- Begins to miss unique aspects of each item
- May hallucinate expected responses instead of actual analysis
- Quality degrades without obvious warning signs

**Why it happens:**
- LLMs are excellent pattern mimics
- Uniform context creates strong behavioral imitation
- Agent follows established rhythm rather than adapting
- Few-shot examples become behavioral constraints

**Learning:**
- **Introduce controlled variation** in action formats and templates
- **Use different serialization approaches** for similar tasks
- **Vary prompts and response formats** to break patterns
- **Monitor for mechanical behavior** in repetitive workflows
- **Add deliberate "noise"** to prevent over-rigid patterns

**Warning signs:**
- Responses becoming increasingly similar
- Agent not adapting to unique aspects of tasks
- Declining attention to specific details

### The Clean-Slate Fallacy

**Problem:** Hiding failures from agents prevents learning and adaptation

**Context:** Multi-step agent workflows where errors occur

**Experience:**
- Agent makes mistake (hallucination, wrong tool call, etc.)
- Natural impulse: reset state, retry, or clean up the error
- Agent repeats same mistake because it has no evidence of failure
- Errors become systematic rather than occasional
- Debugging becomes impossible without failure context

**Why this happens:**
- Error traces provide crucial learning signals
- Context deletion removes adaptation opportunities
- Models can't improve without seeing consequences
- "Clean" contexts don't reflect real-world messiness

**Learning:**
- **Keep failure context** - let agents see their mistakes
- **Preserve error traces** in conversation history
- **Allow agents to learn** from their own corrections
- **Document failure patterns** for analysis
- **Trust the model's ability** to adapt from evidence

**Implementation:**
```
BAD:  [Error occurs] ‚Üí Clear context ‚Üí Retry
GOOD: [Error occurs] ‚Üí Document failure ‚Üí Continue with evidence
```

## üöÄ Call for Contributions

**This section needs YOUR hard-won lessons!**

The most valuable insights come from real mistakes and unexpected discoveries. Share your experiences to help others avoid the same pitfalls.

### üéØ What We're Looking For

**Real experiences with:**
- **Over-reliance failures** - When trusting LLM output too much backfired
- **Quality control disasters** - How hallucinations or errors slipped through
- **Workflow mistakes** - Process decisions that seemed good but caused problems
- **Context management fails** - When conversations went off the rails
- **Integration problems** - Tool or workflow combinations that didn't work
- **Security or compliance issues** - Where LLM usage created unexpected risks

### üìù Contribution Template

```markdown
### [Descriptive Title of the Pitfall]

**Problem:** [Brief description of what went wrong]

**Context:** [What you were trying to achieve, environment, constraints]

**Experience:** [What actually happened - the failure or issue]
- [Specific details of the problem]
- [What made it worse or hard to detect]
- [Impact or consequences]

**Learning:** [How to avoid this pitfall]
- [Warning signs to watch for]
- [Better approaches or workflows]
- [Preventive measures]
```

### üí° Examples We Need

- **The Confident Hallucination** - When an LLM gave detailed but completely wrong technical information
- **The Security Slip** - Accidentally exposing sensitive data through prompts
- **The Context Collapse** - Long conversations that lost track of key constraints
- **The Dependency Disaster** - Code that used non-existent libraries or APIs
- **The Style Drift** - Projects where AI-generated content became inconsistent
- **The Review Trap** - Missing critical issues because you trusted AI too much
