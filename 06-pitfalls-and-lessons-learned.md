## Core Development Pitfalls

### The LLM as Scripting Engine Trap

**Problem:** Using LLMs directly as runtime scripting engines instead of code generators

**Context:** Building applications where business logic, data processing, or API integrations need to be flexible and user-configurable

**Experience:** The temptation is strong - let users describe what they want in natural language, send that to an LLM at runtime, and execute the result. This seems like the ultimate flexible system.

**What actually happens:**
- Same input produces different outputs on different runs
- Business logic becomes unpredictable and unreliable
- Debugging becomes impossible - no consistent execution path
- Production systems fail in subtle, hard-to-reproduce ways
- Performance suffers from LLM latency in critical paths
- Costs explode from repeated LLM calls
- Compliance and auditing become nightmares

**Real-world example:**
```javascript
// THE TRAP - DON'T DO THIS
async function processUserData(userRequest, data) {
    const result = await llm.query(`
        Process this data: ${JSON.stringify(data)}
        User wants: ${userRequest}
        Return the processed result
    `);
    return JSON.parse(result); // Non-deterministic disaster!
}
```

**Why it seems appealing:**
- Appears to offer ultimate flexibility
- Natural language configuration feels user-friendly
- Seems to eliminate complex rule engines
- Promises to handle edge cases automatically

**Why it fails:**
- LLMs are inherently non-deterministic
- Same prompt can yield different logic flows
- No way to test or validate business logic
- Error handling becomes impossible
- Performance is unpredictable

**Learning:** **Use LLMs as code generators, not code executors**

The correct approach:
```javascript
// THE SOLUTION - DO THIS INSTEAD
async function generateProcessor(userRequest) {
    const code = await llm.query(`
        Generate JavaScript function to: ${userRequest}
        Return only valid, testable JavaScript code
        Include error handling and validation
    `);
    
    // Validate, test, and compile the generated code
    const processor = validateAndCompile(code);
    return processor; // Now deterministic!
}

// Use the generated processor repeatedly
const processor = await generateProcessor("calculate tax based on region");
const result1 = processor(data1); // Consistent
const result2 = processor(data2); // Predictable
```

**Extended applications:**
- **Configuration management**: Generate config files, don't query for values
- **SQL queries**: Generate and validate queries, don't ask LLM to "process data"
- **API integrations**: Generate client code, don't route calls through LLM
- **Business rules**: Generate rule engines, don't evaluate rules via LLM
- **Data transformations**: Generate transformation functions, don't transform on-demand

**Warning signs you're in the trap:**
- Production logic depends on LLM responses
- Same input sometimes produces different business outcomes
- You can't write unit tests for core functionality
- Debugging requires analyzing LLM conversation logs
- Performance is inconsistent due to API latency

**The fundamental insight:** LLMs are excellent **development tools** but terrible **runtime engines**. Generate code during development or setup phases, then execute that code deterministically in production.

## AI Agent Development Pitfalls

*Source: [Context Engineering for AI Agents - Manus](https://manus.im/de/blog/Context-Engineering-for-AI-Agents-Lessons-from-Building-Manus)*

### The Few-Shot Pattern Trap

**Problem:** Agents get stuck in repetitive behavior when context contains similar action-observation patterns

**Context:** Building an agent to process multiple similar tasks (e.g., reviewing 20 resumes, processing documents)

**Experience:** 
- Agent starts performing well on first few items
- Gradually becomes mechanical, following exact same pattern
- Begins to miss unique aspects of each item
- May hallucinate expected responses instead of actual analysis
- Quality degrades without obvious warning signs

**Why it happens:**
- LLMs are excellent pattern mimics
- Uniform context creates strong behavioral imitation
- Agent follows established rhythm rather than adapting
- Few-shot examples become behavioral constraints

**Learning:**
- **Introduce controlled variation** in action formats and templates
- **Use different serialization approaches** for similar tasks
- **Vary prompts and response formats** to break patterns
- **Monitor for mechanical behavior** in repetitive workflows
- **Add deliberate "noise"** to prevent over-rigid patterns

**Warning signs:**
- Responses becoming increasingly similar
- Agent not adapting to unique aspects of tasks
- Declining attention to specific details

### The Clean-Slate Fallacy

**Problem:** Hiding failures from agents prevents learning and adaptation

**Context:** Multi-step agent workflows where errors occur

**Experience:**
- Agent makes mistake (hallucination, wrong tool call, etc.)
- Natural impulse: reset state, retry, or clean up the error
- Agent repeats same mistake because it has no evidence of failure
- Errors become systematic rather than occasional
- Debugging becomes impossible without failure context

**Why this happens:**
- Error traces provide crucial learning signals
- Context deletion removes adaptation opportunities
- Models can't improve without seeing consequences
- "Clean" contexts don't reflect real-world messiness

**Learning:**
- **Keep failure context** - let agents see their mistakes
- **Preserve error traces** in conversation history
- **Allow agents to learn** from their own corrections
- **Document failure patterns** for analysis
- **Trust the model's ability** to adapt from evidence

**Implementation:**
```
BAD:  [Error occurs] ‚Üí Clear context ‚Üí Retry
GOOD: [Error occurs] ‚Üí Document failure ‚Üí Continue with evidence
```
